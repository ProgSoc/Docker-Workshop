# What is Docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping and running applications.

## Use Cases

- Standardised Development Environments
  - Consistent setup across different machines
- CI/CD of your changes
  - Unit Testing
  - Deploying to Prod

### Example Workflow

- Write code locally or using cloud compute using standardised development containers.
- Upon pushing changes, build a docker image and run unit tests
- Push images to prod using a container registry like Docker Hub or Github Container Registry.

## Docker Architecture

![Docker Image](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/images/docker-architecture.webp)

> Docker follows a client-server architecture, made up of a client(Docker CLI), a server (Docker Daemon) and a registry.

### Docker Client

The Docker client is run through `docker` or `docker compose` when orchestrating a set of containers, volumes and networking configurations.

### Docker Daemon

The docker server `dockerd` manages images, containers, networking and volumes. It communicates with the `docker` client usually over UNIX sockets.

### Docker Registry

A Docker registry is a place where docker images are stored.

Examples Include:

- Github Container Registry
- Docker Hub

### Docker Objects

#### Images

These are are a read-only template with instructions for creating a docker container. Usually, these are based on another image, but with relevant customisations applied.

##### Building Images

Images are built using a `Dockerfile` to define the steps needed to create an image and run it. Each instruction provided in a dockerfile creates a "layer", particular to that change. This means that when modifying a dockerfile, only the layers changed are rebuilt.

#### Docker Containers

Containers are runnable instances of a specified image, managable through the docker client. These may be connected to networks, storage and other containers.

When containers are removed, any changes to state that haven't been stored in persistent storage aren't captured.
